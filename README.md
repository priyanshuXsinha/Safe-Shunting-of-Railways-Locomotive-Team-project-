## 📊 System Workflow

1. **Ultrasonic Sensor** continuously checks distance between compartments
2. If too close → Arduino **stops DC motors** and shows warning on LCD
3. **AI Camera on Raspberry Pi** scans surroundings via servo motor
4. If object (human/animal) detected →  
   - Pi freezes servo at that angle  
   - Sends STOP signal to Arduino  
   - Arduino halts motor and triggers alarm  
5. Once object clears → system resumes scanning and movement

## ⚙️ Software Setup

### Raspberry Pi:
- Install Sony IMX500 SDK
- Install YOLOv8 model as `.rpk`
- Run `recognition.py` for object detection
- Uses **GPIO17** for servo and **GPIO communication** with Arduino

### Arduino:
- Uses **LiquidCrystal_I2C** library for LCD
- Uses **NewPing** library for ultrasonic sensors
- Controls DC motors via L298N driver
- Stops motors when:
  - Distance is too small (compartments too close)
  - STOP signal received from Pi

---

## ▶️ Running the Project

1. Power up Raspberry Pi and Arduino
2. Start `recognition.py` on Pi:
   ```bash
   python3 recognition.py
   ```
3. Arduino auto-starts on reset
4. Monitor LCD for distance/status
5. Servo rotates camera → object detection handled by Pi
6. If danger detected → Arduino halts motor and buzzer rings
